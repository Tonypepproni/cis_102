        The Embedded Capture the Flag (eCTF) Competition, run by MITRE, 
        is a challenge focused on designing and attacking secure embedded systems. 
        Participants first work in teams to create a secure system for an embedded device based on specific requirements. 
        In the second phase, teams analyze and attack each otherâ€™s systems, testing the security of their designs. 
        This competition offers a hands-on experience in both building and breaking embedded security systems, 
        with real physical devices involved.
