        <h2>About the Competition</h2>


        <p>
            The Embedded Capture the Flag (eCTF) Competition, run by MITRE, 
            is a challenge focused on designing and attacking secure embedded systems. 
            Participants first work in teams to create a secure system for an embedded device based on specific requirements. 
            In the second phase, teams analyze and attack each otherâ€™s systems, testing the security of their designs. 
            This competition offers a hands-on experience in both building and breaking embedded security systems, 
            with real physical devices involved.
        </p>


        <p>
            In the 2025 eCTF, teams will design and implement a Satellite TV system. 
            The system must securely encode and decode satellite TV data 
            streams while protecting against unauthorized access to protected channels.
